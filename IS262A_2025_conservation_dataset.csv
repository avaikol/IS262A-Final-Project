Small samples were taken for analysis which confirmed that the material was dominated by lead white (basic lead carbonate) combined with a drying oil binder, casein and gum. Stone paper mockups revealed that the addition of casein was crucial to forming a resistant, stable coating for printing, but it also formed a brittle film, and casein was likely a contributing factor to the development of losses in the image during printing. Etch tests carried out on mockups showed that stone paper reacts more like a metal plate than a limestone, and that etching with tannic acid was most effective at stabilizing the matrix.
